# Deployment Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the **Chess** project and setting up the PHP WebSocket server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- PHP 7.4 or higher installed
- Composer installed

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the **Chess** project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osalotioman/Chess.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Chess
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install the required dependencies for the PHP WebSocket server:

```bash
composer install
```

## Step 3: Configure the Web Server

### Apache

If you are using Apache, create a virtual host configuration for the **Chess** project. Add the following configuration to your Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `apache2.conf`):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName chess.local
    DocumentRoot /path/to/Chess/html

    <Directory /path/to/Chess/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/chess_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/chess_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, create a server block configuration for the **Chess** project. Add the following configuration to your Nginx configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf` or `sites-available/default`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name chess.local;

    root /path/to/Chess/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/chess_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/chess_access.log;
}
```

## Step 4: Update Hosts File

Update your hosts file to map the `chess.local` domain to `localhost`. Add the following line to your hosts file:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1   chess.local
```

## Step 5: Start the Web Server

Start your web server to serve the **Chess** project. For Apache, use the following command:

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

For Nginx, use the following command:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

## Step 6: Start the PHP WebSocket Server

Navigate to the `server` directory and start the PHP WebSocket server using Composer:

```bash
cd server
composer start
```

## Step 7: Access the Game

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://chess.local
```

You should now be able to play the **Chess** game locally.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment, check the following:

- Ensure your web server is running and properly configured.
- Verify that PHP and Composer are installed and working correctly.
- Check the web server and PHP error logs for any error messages.

Happy playing!
